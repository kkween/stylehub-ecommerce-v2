Agile Scrum Getting Started Notes

1. Start Small: Don’t try to perfect everything. Use the templates provided and keep your process lightweight.
2. Learn by Doing: Create your Jira project, add your backlog items, and invite your team. Try running a short (1-week) sprint to get familiar.
3. Use Templates: Use the onboarding checklist to set up your team, the sprint planning template to organize your first sprint, and the standup template for daily check-ins.
4. Ask for Feedback: After your first sprint, ask your team what worked and what didn’t. Adjust your process based on their input.
5. Focus on Communication: Keep everyone informed and encourage open discussion about progress and blockers.
6. Don’t Worry About Mistakes: Agile is about continuous improvement. Mistakes are normal and help you learn.
7. Use Jira’s Help Resources: Jira has built-in guides and tutorials—use them if you get stuck.

Jira Setup Questions:
- Yes, you need to set up Jira before starting your first sprint.
- You can run Jira in Docker (Jira Software Data Center edition), but most users start with Jira Cloud (hosted by Atlassian) for simplicity.
- If you want to run Jira locally, you’ll need to download it or use Docker. Jira Cloud is easier for beginners and free for small teams.

Next Steps:
- Let me know if you want instructions for Jira Cloud or Docker setup.
- Once Jira is ready, I’ll walk you through your first sprint step-by-step.
