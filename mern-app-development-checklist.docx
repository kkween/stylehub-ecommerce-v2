Additional Steps for Building a MERN Application

1. Version Control
- Use Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) for source code management.
- Create feature branches for each user story or task.

2. Development Environment
- Set up local development and testing environments.
- Document setup steps for your team.

3. Code Reviews
- Establish a process for peer code reviews before merging changes.

4. Testing
- Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- Use tools like Jest, Mocha, Cypress, etc.

5. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Automate builds, tests, and deployments using tools like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or Jenkins.

6. Documentation
- Document APIs, architecture, and setup instructions.
- Keep README files up to date.

7. Security
- Implement authentication, authorization, and data validation.
- Regularly update dependencies.

8. Feedback & Demos
- Demo progress to stakeholders at the end of each sprint.
- Gather feedback and adjust backlog as needed.

9. Retrospectives
- Hold regular retrospectives to improve team processes.

10. Production Readiness
- Prepare for deployment (hosting, environment variables, backups).
- Monitor application health and performance.

Use this checklist to ensure a smooth and professional development process for your MERN application.
