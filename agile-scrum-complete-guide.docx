1. What Are User Stories?
A user story is a short, simple description of a feature or requirement from the perspective of the end user. It helps teams understand what to build and why, focusing on user needs.
Format: As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit].
Examples:
- As a user I want to register so I can access my account.
- As a user I want to log in so I can access my dashboard.
- As a user I want to view products so I can shop.
- As a user I want to see product details.
- As a user I want to add products to my cart.
- As a user I want to checkout and pay.
- As a user I want to view my past orders.
- As an admin I want to manage products and orders.
- As a user I want to change my password.

2. Story Points Meaning
Story points estimate the relative effort, complexity, and time required for each backlog item. They help teams plan sprints and track progress.

| 1            | Very easy, quick, or simple task                            |
