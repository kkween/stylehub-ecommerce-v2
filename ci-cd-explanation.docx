# What is CI/CD and What Does ci.yml Do?

## CI/CD Explained

- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  - Automatically runs tests and checks on new code to catch errors early and keep the codebase healthy.
  - Developers push code to a shared repository, and automated workflows validate the code.

- **Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD):**
  - Automatically deploys code to production or staging after it passes all checks.
  - Ensures new features and fixes go live quickly and safely.

## What is ci.yml?

- `ci.yml` is a workflow configuration file for GitHub Actions.
- It tells GitHub how to automatically check your code every time you push or open a pull request.
- It automates tasks like:
  - Installing dependencies
  - Running tests
  - Running lint checks
  - Building your project
  - Deploying code (if configured)

## How is ci.yml Similar to Jenkins?

- Both automate CI/CD tasks (testing, building, deploying).
- Jenkins is a standalone tool you install and configure.
- GitHub Actions (using `ci.yml`) is built into GitHub and easier to set up for most projects.

## Summary

- `ci.yml` automates code checks and can automate deployment.
- GitHub Actions and Jenkins both provide CI/CD, but GitHub Actions is integrated with GitHub.
- CI/CD helps teams deliver high-quality code faster and with fewer errors.
